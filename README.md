<h4>Project Title: Collaborative Wiki</h4>
<h5>Author: Sam Camus (xdothackerx) </h5>

Approach: Tried to create the app from the Active Record Documentation and one of the old workflowies... didn't work too well. I can't tell what's wrong, though. D:

Take 2: Followed along in class, then messed around with other stuff like adding a logout link and user with most recent edit for practice.
